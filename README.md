# voizy â€” a contact form for voice messages.

## Installation

For usage, a free account at [voizy.de](https://voizy.de/#testen) is required.

You'll get a so called listener id which the plugin needs.

## Usage

After installation, a new Gutenberg block called voizy is available. There you're able to customize the widget and insert given listener id. Just save the block and users are ready to send you voice messages.

If you don't use Gutenberg, there is also a shortcode (of course): `[voizy id=1234 theme="light" context="Something" color="ff0000" privacy-opt-in=true privacy-url="https://example.com"]`
